# WF-NTPv3.0
Wide-field nematode tracking platform v3.0

The WF-NTP is a platform for analyzing movement behaviour of C. elegans. It is a open-source platform under the license of GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL3.0).

# Overview
The WF-NTP software runs in python and only requires an installation of python and integrated libraries. All the required software can be found in the python and plugins directory. 
The actual code to run the plaform is provided in the JBKirkgaard.. library. Please read all instructions in our Nature Protocols paper (add link).

# Demos
The output generated by the WF-NTP concerning a wild-type N2 movie included. This data can be used to play with the software and to work with it. Also the 'settings.py' file is included, in which the used settings can be seen. Note: the demo video is accesible via dropbox, since the videos are too big (>1GB) for uploading purposes at github (https://www.dropbox.com/s/1xifhhy7nnewd8j/N2-2_2019-07-29-133409-0000.avi?dl=0). However, video's can also always be requested by one of the corresponding authors.
